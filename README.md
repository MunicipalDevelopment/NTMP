# Neighborhood Traffic Management Program
This application allows citizens to submit a traffic calming request. 
See the [City of Albuquerque website](http://www.cabq.gov/traffic/) for more information on the NTMP program.

The application is a Leaflet map that allows the user to enter an address or drop a marker on the map.
The user then selects the from and to streets and fills out the popup form. Clicking submit sends them to a confirmation page with their application number.

The application then follows the same process as the original paper application. This just eliminates the need to download and print a paper form and mail or scan to email back.
It also allows the City to keep a database of request in our GIS system without requiring an employee to add them manually.
